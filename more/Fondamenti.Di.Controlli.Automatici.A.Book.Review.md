# Fondamenti Di Controlli Automatici: A Book Review
 
Fondamenti Di Controlli Automatici is a book by Paolo Bolzern, Riccardo Scattolini and Nicola Schiavoni that presents the basic elements of system theory and control. The third edition of the book features a new chapter dedicated to two non-trivial application cases, as well as an increased number of exercises and problems at the end of each chapter. The book also provides some Matlab/Simulink programs and schemes that implement the algorithms presented in the text or that can be used for simulation and design purposes.

The book is divided into four parts: Part I introduces the concepts of system, model, state and stability; Part II deals with linear systems, their representation, analysis and properties; Part III covers the design of feedback controllers for linear systems, both in the frequency and time domains; Part IV extends the concepts and methods to nonlinear systems, discrete-time systems and multivariable systems.
 
The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students of engineering who want to learn the fundamentals of control theory and practice. It is also a useful reference for researchers and practitioners who work on control problems in various fields. The book assumes some basic knowledge of calculus, linear algebra and complex numbers, but it also provides some notes on these topics on its website.
 
The book can be downloaded for free from the Internet Archive[^1^] or from other sources[^2^] [^3^]. It is written in Italian and has 653 pages.
  
Some of the topics covered in the book are: system classification, state-space models, linearization, equilibrium points and stability, transfer functions and block diagrams, frequency response and Bode plots, Nyquist criterion and stability margins, root locus method, PID controllers, pole placement and state feedback, observer design and output feedback, Lyapunov stability theory, phase plane analysis and describing functions, sampling and z-transform, discrete-time systems and controllers, frequency response and stability of discrete-time systems, state-space models and canonical forms of multivariable systems, controllability and observability of multivariable systems, pole assignment and decoupling for multivariable systems.
 
The book is well-written and clear, with many examples and figures to illustrate the concepts and methods. The exercises and problems are challenging and relevant, and some of them are solved in the appendix. The book also provides some historical notes on the development of control theory and its applications. The book is a comprehensive and rigorous introduction to control engineering that can help students and professionals to master the subject.
  
One of the strengths of the book is that it covers both classical and modern control techniques, as well as some advanced topics that are usually not found in introductory textbooks. For example, the book discusses the design of nonlinear controllers using feedback linearization and backstepping, the design of discrete-time controllers using deadbeat control and predictive control, and the design of multivariable controllers using optimal control and robust control. The book also introduces some concepts and tools from system identification, adaptive control and intelligent control.
 
Another strength of the book is that it provides some practical examples and case studies that show how control theory can be applied to real-world problems. For instance, the book presents the design and implementation of a controller for a magnetic levitation system, a controller for a flexible robot arm, a controller for a DC motor, a controller for a helicopter, a controller for a cruise control system, and a controller for a chemical reactor. The book also discusses some applications of control theory to biological systems, such as the regulation of blood glucose level and the control of gene expression.
 
The book is accompanied by a website that contains some additional material and resources for the readers. The website offers some notes on complex numbers, some Matlab/Simulink programs and schemes that can be downloaded and used for simulation and design purposes, some solutions to selected exercises and problems, and some links to other useful websites on control engineering. The website also provides some information on how to contact the authors and give feedback on the book.
